as described hy dphraern Syrus, placed the general prayers oster the ln·
vocation 01 tho Hour dacor?

To this there ars tvvo very easy auswers. The tirst is that, grao-
ting hir. Palmer's statement correct, it hy no means proves the point.
The drenge 01 the ploce 01 0 prayer nas no unusual occurrence io Li·
turgies3 thus, iu the present lioman hlass, prayer is not made lor the
'departed till aiter the consecration; in ths Gelestae Sacramentary, it was
anade heloro. Are the tvvo cilices, therelore, to all intents andpurposes,
not the same? So in the Church 01 Constantinople, at least as lateas
h. D. 536, the diptychs preceded consecration; they non follow it; yet
the Liturgy 01 that time and 01 this is almost word ior word the same.
This is just a parallel cass to that which we are considering.

But, in truth, the vvords 01 S. Ephraem hy no means imply that the
general intercession, in his time, loliorved the invocation. lle says, “The
Priesthood soors holdly to heaven lrom earth, until it beholds the inri-
sihle Himsell; and ialls town aad prays to the hono lor llis servants,
carrying the tears aad groaru 01 its follow-servants, andpresenting them
fervently to its own Master3 in the same way also supplication and prayer,
asking forgiveness, and pity, and meroy irom the meroilollling3 dratthe
licor Guosr, the Paraclete, may descend, and may sanctily the gilts pro·
posed upon the earth, and when oblatinn is made 01 the iearlul myste-
¹ries, iuli 01 immortality, through tho presiding Priest, vrho makes prayer
lor all, then souis corne iorvvard, receiving purification 01 their sins
through tha leariul hlystcries.” Now ,1 contend that the sentence which
speaks 01 the Priest falling down and prayiog to uotam lor 1110000-
vants, is much more likely to reler to the general intercession than is

tlte vague expression, “who makes prayer lor all.’' 1 may ohserve also,
that the presentation 01 the tears and groans 01 the servants 01 Gon
agrees very well with tlre actual tenor 01 tho Nestorian intercession, as
it now stands; while, alter the lnvooation 01 the Hotv Gnoso, there is

a short prayer lor all, which is perhaps referred to hy S. Ephraem. The
words 01 that Father, then, so iar as they tell either vray, are in accor-
10000 nith the view 1 hare taken.

On the whole, 1 conclude that the primitive Liturgy 01 the East,
not mors changed in that oi tha¹ Apostles than those ol Alexandria and
Jerusalem in the present ollices 01 S. lamas and S. ldark, exceptio the
oue lact 01 the words 01 institution having heen, as we shall see, omit-
ted, is one 01 the earliest, aad perhaps the very earliest, 01 the many
formularies 01 the Christian Sacrilioe. ilaving said thus much in viudi-
cation 01 the antiquity 01 this rite, lproceed to a hriei revievv 01 the
various memhsrs 01011 the Liturgical familias.
