Canon sullieiently acquaints‘us with the spirit ot all the minor Ethiopic
&wilhies-The Liturgical family which we may call the llierolymi-
tan, is hy lar tbe largest. The original rite is the Greek oliice oi S.
lanas, probably, as l bare said, one olptbe oldest now extant. lt is
still said in many chorches ol Greeoe ou tbe aare oi October, which is,

in the Eastern Churoh‚ the Festiral ol 8. James. From this Greek Li-
turgy tbere are three sets ol olisboots.

The lirst ol tlrese is the Caesarean braneh. S. Blsrn’s Liturgy is
a recast ol 8. trees, as S. Cnnrsosrou’s is an abbreviation and new
edition ol S. Basil’s. From S. basil's sprang the Annam-Gnaeonun rite,
as at present used3 while S. Cnnrsosrou’s exeroised an inlluenoe ou the
later lorms ol the Nestoriaus. circumstances have rendered the Constan-
tinopolitan nites, as l bave already said, sole possessors ol the Orthodox
East. The Liturgy ol S. Basil is said on all Sundays in Leut, except
Palm Sunday, on blaundy Thursday‚ Easter Ere, the Vigil ol Christmas
and the Epiphany, and tbe feast ol S. basil, (too. 1.) That ol S. Chry-
sostom is appropriated to every other day iu the year. The latter, in
the Euchologies‚ invariably' precedes the lormor3 and serres as, de sueto,
its normal lorm.

The second oilshoot ol S. diues is ol lar less importance. lt em-
braccs but two olfices: the Sicilian Liturgy, which was diret published‚
though in a very imperfect state, by keseman: the other named irem S.
Cyni, which was never used widely, and ol which it is impossible to say
where it was employed. The Sicilian Liturgy differs principally from that
ol S. dames in amplification: though it contains a remarkable explanation
ol the prayers for Saints ollered by the bastern Cburcb at the bitur,
aud seems intended to approximate to the tben received Latin doctrine.
The date ol this Liturgy is earlier than 984. The ollice oi S. Cyrilis
variously argued to bare been merely one ol the numerous Syro-Jaco-
bite Liturgies‚ or the rite ol some Orthodox Cburcb dependent on Jeru-
salem. l inclinato the latter opinion.

The third onsbooc ul the hierosolymitan ollioc is the Srnrac Liturgy
ol S. lewes, aud its dependente. lt differs verbally lrom the Greek office
ol the same name, lrom which itis derived. The prayers are, generally
speaking, rather shorter; though the luvocation ol the llonr Gaosr is
much amplilied. lt is remarkable lor having two pro-anaphoral forms,
both comparatirely late and ralueless: and these are the norms ol all
(ΧΗ) Syro-Jacobite Liturgies. - -
